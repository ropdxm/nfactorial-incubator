I tried to implement noSQL database using just a single json file. To interact with it, you can make api calls or go to the website and interact with it there. 

To get started, just npm install in client and server directories.
npm run dev - in client
npm start - in server

and everything should be good to go!


Shotout to nfactorial team: Even though i chose fullstack development as my track in typeform, i would also love to take ios development tracks! If you find my work pretty impressive but fullstack development is full, then feel free to add me to ios developemnt track(I wouldn't say im master at ios, but i had exprience working with it and i would loove to join ios track!!). Thanks in advance!!!
